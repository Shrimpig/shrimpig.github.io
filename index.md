Welcome to Tianrou Xia's home page! I am a Research Scientist in the [CyFI Lab](https://cyfi.ece.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working under the supervision of Prof. [Brendan D. Saltaformaggio](https://saltaformaggio.ece.gatech.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Informatics from The Pennsylvania State University, where I was advised by Prof. [Dinghao Wu](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/wu/) and co-advised by Prof. [Taegyu Kim](https://tgkim.gitlab.io/).

My research focuses on software and system security, particularly on static program analysis, control-flow integrity, memory safety, programming language analysis and the security of Rust-based systems. More recently, my work has expanded toward forensics analysis of robotics and edge AI, as well as large language model security.

I am open to research collaborations related to these areas.
