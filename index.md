I am a Research Scientist in the CyFI Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working under the supervision of Prof. Brendan D. Saltaformaggio. I received my Ph.D. in Informatics from The Pennsylvania State University, where I was advised by Prof. Dinghao Wu and co-advised by Prof. Taegyu Kim.

My research focuses on software and systems security, with particular emphasis on static program analysis, control-flow integrity, memory safety, and Rust security. More recently, my work has expanded toward robotics and edge AI security, large language model security, and memory forensics.

I am open to research collaborations related to these areas.
